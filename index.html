<h4>Welcome</h4>
<p>
    Welcome to my website! Here I have a variety of things posted, including
    some of my own projects and writings, as well as those of others.
    This website has been through many iterations as well as various styles.
    It is currently a simple HTML-only page, which is intentional as this site
    is designed to be incredibly simple. 
</p>

<h4>About Me</h4>
<p>
    I am half Palestinian half American.
    I grew up in Florida, and have lived in the American South my
    entire life. I have travelled to quite a few places in the world,
    mainly Jordan and Canada. 
</p><br>

<p>
    My main interests are programming, operating systems, music (I play the Alto Saxophone),
    politics. My favorite academic subjects are mathematics as well as any world language.
    I am currently taking Spanish in school, and I have a strong interest in Russian, mainly
    from their music, political theorists, and philosophers. I intend to learn Russian
    when I have the time. My favorite programming language is C.
</p><br>

<p>
    Si quiere practicar español con mi, envíenme un email (Perdón por los errores).<br>
    Если вы русский, пришлите мне русские песни. (Я плохо говорю по-русски, это из гугла переводчик).
</p>

<h4>My Political Ideology</h4>
<p>
    I am an Anarcho-Communist, and as such I host books, images, links, and
    various documents about Anarchist Communism and related ideologies and ideas.
    I find that the state is unnecessary for happiness and a coordinated society, 
    and that it is conducive with oppression. 
    I belive in freedom and equality for all - regardless
    of race, sex, and sexual or gender orientation. I 
    oppose all ideologies focused on the state, conducive hierarchies,
    nationalism, etc. (essentially I am against every authoritarian ideology - left wing or right wing).
    This means I am against Fascists, Nazis, Liberals, Libertarians / Anarcho Capitalists, Marxists, Maoists, as well
    as Conservatives and <b>both</b> political parties of the United States - although Republican is
    (in my opinion) the worse of the two. I am against Capitalism, as it results
    in severe inequality between worker and CEO, as well as the exploitation
    of the lower class.
</p><br>

<p>
    For those with criticism, I suggest reading the following books - each hosted
    on this site's <a href="/library">library</a>. For those with 
    questions about the practicality of Anarchist Communism or those who are looking
    for examples of Anarchist ideas in practice, I suggest reading 
    <a href="library/peter-gelderloos-anarchy-works.pdf">Anarchy Works</a> by Peter Gelderloos.
    Other books I recommend reading are <a href="/library/petr-kropotkin-the-conquest-of-bread.pdf">
        The Conquest of Bread</a> 
    and <a href="/library/petr-kropotkin-mutual-aid-a-factor-of-evolution.pdf">Mutual Aid</a>, both
    written by one of the most influential Anarchists (if not THE most influential) - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin">Pëtr Kropotkin</a>.
</p>

<h4>Software</h4>
<p>
    I believe in free as in freedom software in all aspects.
    Free software meaning software that the user has control over,
    <b>not the other way around.</b> You should be able to use a
    program to satisfy your needs - meaning you should be able to modify
    and redistribute it as you see fit, so long as you keep it free software.
    You can read more about free software <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">here</a>.
</p><br>

<p>
    I personally use <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> with almost entirely free software.
    I highly recommend Gentoo for those wishing to expand upon their Linux knowledge. 
    I also suggest <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Kernel">configuring and compiling</a> 
    your own kernel - not only to learn but to have a more lightweight sytem.
</p><br>

<p>
    I use <a href="https://suckless.org">suckless</a> software, 
    such as <a href="https://github.com/prismz/dwm">dwm</a>, 
    <a href="https://github.com/prismz/st">st</a>, 
    and <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">dmenu</a>.
    I use dwm with my own custom status program mentioned below. note that my dwm
    configuration is custom tuned for my custom keyboard layout.
</p><br>

<p>
    I use a keyboard layout called <a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a>. I switched on 11/14/21, and 
    so far I have made quite significant progress. I did not switch to become
    faster - but to save my wrists in the long term as I do a lot of typing.
    I <b>highly</b> recommend Colemak for those who get wrist pain while typing
    or for those who suffer from RSI or arthritis.
</p>

<h4>Projects</h4>
<p>
    I have various projects - almost all written in C:

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/prismz/aurinstall">aurinstall</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/prismz/ns">ns</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/prismz/wordsearch-solver">wordsearch-solver</a></li>
    </ul>

    as well as my own configurations of suckless software:

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/prismz/dwm">dwm</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/prismz/st">st</a></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    I am currently working on a collection of open source libraries
    for various purposes - the current library being an advanced tokenizer, designed
    to be used within a lexer. I intend to write a few others for text manipulation
    and various other purposes. I also intend to write a second version of some of the
    libraries designed to use as little memory as possible.
