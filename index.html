    <h1>Hasan's Website</h1>
    <h3>The ugliest (but most functional!) website on the internet</h3>
    Hello, and welcome to my website. I have some of my things posted
    here. The website is super ugly and old looking to stop zoomers from reading it.
    I tried making a cool looking website for the longest time
    but I could care less at this point. It has my links and stuff, and thats
    really all it needs. If you care so much about how it looks, then you're 
    probably not someone who'd be interested in my projects in the first place.
    Your 56GiB JQuery NodeJS React Express Bootstrap Kubernetes extravaganza loads slow 
    and it takes forever for the reader to find what they want. You didn't even have to read this.
    You could have scrolled down and looked at the important stuff.
    <br><br>

    I use C or Python for everything because anything else is either niche or just pointless (for what I do at least). 
    I use Python for scripts or things that need libraries and C for everything else.
    I don't even bother with web development. I hate it. Thats why this website looks
    the way it does. <br><br>

    I use Linux and almost only free software. You should too.
