<h3>Hasan Zahra</h3>
<p>
    Welcome to my website. Here I write about my projects, ideas, and hobbies.
    This site has been through quite a few revisions since I first started it in November of 2020.
    Today it exists as a simple HTML only website. This site is generated using a static site generator
    written and configured in Haskell. You can view the source <a href="/gen/">here</a> (It's not the best Haskell).
</p>

<p>
    I have many interests: Programming, mathematics, philosophy, politics, Linux, cars, watches, knives, and more.
    I think that Haskell is the most interesting programming language but I'm not very good at it so I use C.
    I use Gentoo Linux, meaning I compile my own kernel and all my software. I drive my project car, a 
    <a href="/articles/html/celica.html">1990 Toyota Celica GTS</a>. I wear a Casio MDV-106. My favorite knives are
    balisongs (butterfly knives) and I have several. My dream knife is a Benchmade 87. I am an Anarcho-Communist.
</p>

<p>
    I also have quite a few texts hosted on this server. You can view them <a href="/library/">here</a>.
    Most come from the <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/">Anarchist Library</a>.
