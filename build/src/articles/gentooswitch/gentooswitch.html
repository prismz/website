<p>
    Anyone that knows me knows that I really, <i>really</i> like to distrohop.
    I decided to install Gentoo on a whim. I had a weekend to spare and I
    had been wanting to try it for a while, and now that I had 16 gigs of ram,
    compiling wouldn't be an issue, so why not?
</p>

<h3 class="article-subheader">
    How it Started
</h3>
<p>
    I installed Gentoo using a <a href="https://www.system-rescue.org/">System Rescue CD</a>
    with a graphical environment (mainly so I could watch videos and read the handbook while 
    going through the process). Some like to SSH into their livecd and install Gentoo that way,
    but I never really enjoyed doing that. I prefer to actually be interacting with the computer
    I'm installing an operating system onto directly rather than through SSH.
</p>

<p>
    I began how I normally start any installation - I copied a few important files from my 
    old partition to my external hard drive and ran <code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1/</code>. 
    At that point there wasn't any going back. I won't go in depth on the installation process, 
    just a standard Gentoo stage3 to tty install. I did have a few hiccups with my 
    SCSI/IDE controller and some audio drivers but I managed to fix those with a few minutes 
    of skimming ancient forum threads and the Gentoo wiki (how I typically fix issues).

    The Struggle of Valgrind and <code>-march=native</code>
</h3>
<p>
    As the title suggests, things went fine (NVIDIA drivers, custom kernel, all drivers and software)
    except for my frustrating struggle with valgrind. Typically when faced with problems like these
    most people would give up, but I knew something simple was wrong. I searched and searched for 
    the error message I had received. It read something along the lines of:<br><br>
    <code>
        vex amd64->IR: unhandled instruction bytes: (blah blah blah)<br>
        vex amd64->IR:   REX=0 REX.W=0 REX.R=0 REX.X=0 REX.B=0<br>
        vex amd64->IR:   VEX=0 VEX.L=0 VEX.nVVVV=0x0 ESC=NONE<br>

        (...)<br>
    </code><br>
    This was annoying to say the least. For a person like me who writes in C a lot, and has a tendency
    to make stupid mistakes when allocating memory, not being able to use valgrind was definitely a problem.
    After searching for days I finally gave in and made 
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gentoo/comments/pb1xiq/valgrind_unrecognized_instruction_on_all_c/">
        a reddit post</a> on r/Gentoo asking for help.
    Someone there with a beard much longer than mine pointed me to a page I had been searching for for a few days
    that listed CPUs from AMD and Intel and their respective <code>-march</code> options.
    I added a few C debug flags to my <code>make.conf</code>, and changed my <code>-march</code> to <code>bdver2</code>,
    the proper <code>-march</code> for an AMD FX-6300 (my CPU). I recompiled my entire system (ouch) and voil√†,
    I had a working valgrind setup.

<h3 class="article-subheader">Why Gentoo?</h3>
<p>
    I remember a few years ago when I first started getting into Linux, after my first time
    installing Manjaro as my main operating system. I was curious as to what the most complicated
    distro out there looked like (I'm aware of LFS, but LFS isn't really a distro) so I looked it up.
    I watched an hour long video of someone installing Gentoo and my mind was blown. I obviously 
    had no idea how it worked or what any of it meant, but it still peaked my interest.
</p>
<p>
    About a year down the road, I had been using Arch for a while, and Linux didn't really seem so 
    complicated anymore. I knew how it worked, what the file structure meant, how to break and fix it,
    and I had become generally proficient. I enjoyed Arch, but I was started to get annoyed by systemd, and the 
    more I read about it, the less I liked it. I wanted a lightweight system, and I felt like Arch 
    pulled in so many different dependencies and that all the packages had a lot of things I didn't really need.
    I hopped back and forth between Debian and Arch for a few months, before finally revisiting Gentoo.
    I understood Linux well enough to know how Gentoo worked and the reason so many people talked about it.
</p>

<p>
    While certainly not ideal for low spec machines, Gentoo allows those with decent hardware to build their
    own system exactly how they want to. I don't have a DVD drive, so why compile in support for it?
    I don't have an Intel CPU or a MIDI controller, so why build in support for them? Gentoo also just plain 
    uses less RAM. I just feel like I have a more <i>complete and personalized system</i>, and to me 
    that is what matters most.
</p>

<p>
    Gentoo is <i>certainly</i> <b>NOT</b> for everyone, but for those who enjoy it, why not? It's certainly 
    a fun distro to use. All that matters is that you're happy with your distro and your setup, and who
    is anyone else to tell you you're wrong for that? This is why I personally dislike distrowars
    within the Linux community, because one of the key benefits of Linux is <i>choice</i>, and who 
    is anyone else to tell you what to use?
