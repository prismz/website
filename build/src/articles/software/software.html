    Over the years I have used <i>lots</i> of software. Lots of it has been bad,
    but the good software (which is hard to find these days) makes certain tasks much easier.
    If you're a Windows user, consider using cygwin or a similar program for the GNU/Linux-like coreutils.
    All of the programs listed below are open source and should be available in the repositories
    of any GNU/Linux distribution, as well as .exe files for Windows users.

    youtube-dl is an amazing program. It does what the name suggests, downloads YouTube videos.
    However, it has support for <i>many</i> other sites, most of which aren't "supported". It is
    what powers those shady video downloader sites you often see. It is much better to use it
    directly, because of the incredible amount of options you can provide.

<p>
    ffmpeg is a file converter that supports countless file formats, as well as many
    options to modify media files. It supports both video and audio files. It powers more things
    than most realize, as it is used by youtube-dl, and by most major websites.

<p>
    mpv is one of the greatest media players of all time. combined with the above mentioned youtube-dl, mpv
    can stream videos from various sites. The sheer amount of configurability is incredible. The
    man (manual) page for mpv is <i>12368</i> lines long. Obviously, the player doesn't need
    any tweaking to work, but you can customize it to work just the way you want.

    VLC Media Player is another media player. VLC is very good for reading more obscure data,
    such as CDs and old video files. VLC is one of the only video players that still attempt
    to read video data if it detects corruption, a feature which has been said to have saved
    entire movie productions and massive projects.
