<h3>on the kyle rittenhouse verdict</h3>

## foreward

    it is worth noting that a racist, sexist, classist
    state or any affiliated entities should not be trusted
    to properly enforce a guilty verdict upon kyle rittenhouse.

<blockquote>
    "there is no such thing as justice - in or out of court"<br>
    - clarence darrow
</blockquote>


## the verdict

    as the law is written in wisconsin, he is not guilty, but he should be.
    the implications regarding recklessness came into play when
    he brought a weapon to a chaotic situation, which is also where he 
    lost the right to proclaim self defense. if the presence of a gun justifies
    its use, wouldn't whoever shot first be in the right? rittenhouse also said
    on social media that he wished he could shoot people. the is not an issue of
    gun laws - this is an issue of a man intentionally going to a civil rights
    protest with intent to kill protestors, succeeding, and walking free.


## why the law involved doesn't matter

    the above mentioned laws don't matter,
    as anyone with enough money to throw at lawyers
    can get away with anything. the law is not a magical
    book of right and wrong as many seem to treat it as.
    both sides could have claimed self defense.
    attempting to disarm an armed shooter (to defend yourself) as well as shooting
    someone trying to take your gun are both actions able to be defended through
    "self defense", and either verdict would have a bad outcome.
    a guilty verdict would mean more systemic racism towards blacks, as
    a black person who actually defends themself with a weapon may be found guilty, and
    a not guilty verdict means more white supremacists will be able 
    to do the same thing rittenhouse did.


## what this means

    this verdict means that people can go to protests to kill people and get away with it.
    it seems that the old days of unarmed protests are disappearing (if not gone
    already), in favor of armed and violent protest.


## closing

    the judge was also heavily biased, which should be evident to
    anyone who actually paid attention to the trial.
