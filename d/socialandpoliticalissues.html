<h4 id="my_political_ideology">my political ideology [<a href="#my_political_ideology">#</a>]</h4>
<p>
    i am an anarcho-communist. i advise anyone with any prejudice against this
    or any repetitive questions to read <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-gelderloos-anarchy-works.pdf">
        anarchy works by peter gelderloos</a> to gain a better understanding.
    communism has truly gained a horrible reputation since the cold war.
    it has been engrained in the heads of many that communism is an ideology
    of evil, or one that is impossible to implement. these views are understandable
    for someone who has not read much theory. in fact, i used to repeat the same
    things. i advise skeptics to investigate a few of the resources at the end of this section.
    i'm almost tempted to agree with cat-v when they say that
    the word is worse than useless because of how many different definitions and stereotypes
    it has had attached to it. nevertheless, i advise everyone to take some time before
    forming an opinion in your head immediately. due to people's harsh reactions, i often
    label myself a socialist libertarian because it just sounds better to the average person.
    i also wish to state that before i am a communist, i am an anti capitalist.
    i will not bother responding to repetitive questions. i advise everyone to read <i>anarchy works</i>. 
    all common questions should be answered there.

<h4 id="gay_marriage">gay marriage [<a href="#gay_marriage">#</a>]</h4>
<p>
    gay marriage should not be a problem. this is solely
    for the reasons stated by <a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/society/gay_marriage">cat-v</a>.
    while i do not agree with everything cat-v says, they make some good points.
    the government should not be involved in marriage, <i>period.</i> marriage being tied
    to the government is absurd, and cat-v makes a good point:

<blockquote>
    "there is no justification for the word ‘marriage’ to be part of any law. 
    and if so inclined, it should be up to the involved parties to come up with a 
    contractual agreement that fits their wishes."
</blockquote>

    however, if fighting for gay marriage is necessary (which it currently is), i 
    am absolutely pro gay marriage. any consenting parties should be able to marry
    each other.

<p>
    i'd argue that anyone using religion as an excuse to be homophobic is an idiot
    for the reasons outlined in the <a href="#religion">religion section</a> of this
    article.
</p>

<h4 id="gender">gender [<a href="#gender">#</a>]</h4>
<p>
    there are more than two genders. the two gender system was an idea
    spread through colonization. many native cultures have a third "non-binary"
    gender classification, an example being the native american <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-spirit">
        two-spirit</a> label. this has been turned into a political issue recently for
    some reason, even though gender is man made. in fact, through gender's definition it
    can be argued that there is an infinite number of genders, and so far there have been ~100 billion, one for each
    modern human that has ever lived. you could argue even more than that if you really wanted.
</p>

<h4 id="religion">religion [<a href="#religion">#</a>]</h4>
<p>
    religion is a mental illness. just because it is popular does not make it any less
    crazy. despite this, people should be allowed to practice whatever religion they want to
    as long as it does not interfere with the lives of others. george carlin has a <a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/society/religion/carlin">
        great routine about</a> religion.
    people have and always will use religion as an excuse. people will claim those people
    are not "real christians", "real muslims", "real jews", "difference between faith and religion", and
    various other tired claims. what makes a real christian/muslim/jew is slightly different to everyone,
    and while there may be a few generally agreed upon things that define each one, this still does
    not change the fact that religion is a mental illness. some say there are worse paths to follow.
    this is true, but is totally irrelevant. "i'm doing mdma instead of heroin, so it must be good for me right,
    because it comforts me and makes me feel good, right?" religion merely acts a coping mechanism for
    those too scared to think. religion is all about moving the goal post further back. when we prove 
    something else, theists always proclaim, "well what about [xyz]?!", and then we prove xyz and they say,
    "well what about [abc]?!" saying god does not need to have proof is special pleading, and the watchmaker
    argument is incredibly flawed. rationally, the following arguments are equally absurd:
    "the watch is complicated = the watch has a maker" is similar to,
    "the watch was created in the 16th century = god was created in the 16th century".
    so far, no one has been able to explain why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster">pastafarianism</a>
    is less valid as a religion than christianity.

<h4 id="abortion">abortion [<a href="#abortion">#</a>]</h4>
<p>
    women should be able to get abortions safely and at no cost to them.
    unborn babies are not sentient, and forcing a rape victim 
    to give birth would be barbaric. the world is over populated.
    conservatives don't give a shit about the baby once it's born, 
    either. no food stamps, healthcare, good education, etc. but he
    sure as hell better join the army if he gets drafted! 
</p>

<h4 id="privacy">privacy [<a href="#privacy">#</a>]</h4>
<p>
    people are entitled to privacy, and the current landscape of big
    tech certainly does not help people in this regard. people are merely
    there as numbers. this has been proven time and time again by the
    information released about facebook and other similar companies. they sell
    your data, and you are nothing but a number to them. they all deliberate
    to monopolize certain industries, such as online advertising.
</p>

<h4 id="these_may_change">these may change [<a href="#these_may_change">#</a>]</h4>
<p>
    as i get older or read more i may change my views written here. people change their
    ideas and that is okay. in fact, i'd be a little concerned if my views
    had not changed at all 10 years from now.
