    after a long wait for the mechanic, my car is finally in my
    driveway. there are many problems, most of which will be outlined here.
    i will be able to drive very soon (november 12th) so if you're reading 
    after the 12th i'll be on the road (and hopefully in this car)
</p>

<h4 id="about_the_car">about the car [<a href="#about_the_car">#</a>]</h4>

    the car is a 1990 toyota celica gts (with a 5 speed manual). it has this very ugly, dated, and 
    faded "sport" paint job on the outside. it is dark blue inside and outside.
    the car is a 2 door hatchback. the stock wheels are ugly, and the current 
    tires are dry rotted. the windows are tinted, but the tint is peeling. the car runs incredibly rough.
    the floor mats, carpet, and trunk liner are incredibly filthy with sticky stains and blemishes everywhere.
    before i bought it, it had been sitting in a barn for over a year. i bought the car for relatively cheap.
    i wanted a cheap project car, preferably something japanese (though this car is the american version), 
    and i got what i wanted!

    as it is now, there are many problems with the car (most of which are fairly minor,
    and almost all are fixable). currently here is my list of problems (sorted by importance,
    mechanical and safety issues first):

    <ul style="list-style:disc; padding-left:40px;">
        <li>the power steering pump has a leak (hoses have been replaced, suspected rack and pinion/wheel assy)</li>
        <li class="strikethrough">the wheels on the car are ugly and the tires are dry rotted</li>
        <li>the car needs a tune up</li>
        <li class="strikethrough">the reverse lights, driver side brake light, and fog lights don't work</li>
        <li>the rpm guage doesn't work</li>
        <li>the lift hatches for the trunk are broken</li>
        <li>the drivers side window does not work (previously thought to be the motor, but the switch seems faulty)</li>
        <li>the seats, carpet, glovebox (and basically any compartment) are dirty</li>
        <li>windshield wipers are rusted</li>
        <li>many joints need to be lubricated</li>
        <li>all except 1 of the interior lights are out</li>
        <li>the car needs a new paint job</li>
        <li>the trunk is rusted pretty badly</li>
        <li>window tint needs to come off and be tinted later</li>
    </ul><br>
    now for the really nitpicky stuff:
    <ul style="list-style:disc; padding-left:40px;">
        <li>the ac flaps are broken</li>
        <li>the drivers side back seat's push button (to move the seat forward) is broken</li>
        <li>the mirror adjustment button doesn't work</li>
        <li>the car has no owners or repair manual</li>
        <li>the headliner should be replaced</li>
    </ul>
</p>

    as i fix things on the car i'll mark them off on the list above.
    most of the problems are minor and fixable. nothing wrong with the engine,
    so the car runs fine. i originally planned on painting the car black, but i decided 
    to stick with dark blue to match the interior. i bought a set of chrome wheels i'm 
    going to put on, and i'm currently waiting on the lift hatches. i'd like to get 
    all the practical problems sorted out before the actual appearance, but the body 
    work and paint require reservations and take quite a while, so i'll have to plan around
    that. i found a manual on ebay, and it is currently on the way.
