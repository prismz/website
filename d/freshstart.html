<h3>a fresh start</h3>

<p>
    a new beginning! i decided my old site's design was too
    convoluted and i didn't like how it looked. i'm going
    to try to keep the website almost entirely plain-text for
    simplicity's sake. perhaps i'm different from most people
    my age in the sense that i like simple websites. i hate
    when i ask a question and get a link to a blog with hundreds
    of popups or when i'm looking at a page and my adblock's statistics
    show hundreds of blocked ads and trackers. why?
</p>

<p>
    now that i have an actual server with my <a href="mailto:hasan@hasanzahra.xyz">email</a> domain set up,
    there's no reason to run a website with a messy layout or tons of javascript.
    a simple <a href="/d/staticsitegen.html">python script</a>
    combined with a makefile generates my website. a simple stylesheet with
    no fancy rules or css hacks, that generates an incredibly simple
    look. who needs javascript for a simple website? it unnecessarily
    complicates things and just adds weight. it also discourages people
    who have javascript disabled for security reasons. while these people may be called "nerds",
    they're my target audience.
</p>

<p>
    i didn't have many articles on my website before since i
    didn't write much. after switching to gentoo, i have plenty
    to write about. maybe one day when school doesn't take up all
    my time i can try out linux from scratch or freebsd/openbsd.
    i've used linux for about 1 1/2 - 2 years now, and i've learned
    a lot. most of which seems obvious to me, but 
    <a href="https://rgz.ee/">roman zolotarev</a> makes a good point:

    <blockquote>
        "something that is obvious to you is not always obvious to other people,
        and something that is boring to you might be fascinating to someone from a
        different culture or who is new to the topic." [<a href="https://rgz.ee/website.html">1</a>]
    </blockquote>

    if my writing or code helps someone else, then i've done my job. i'm not a great 
    writer, but i'll still try to write regularly, whether it be about linux or something else.
    hopefully one day all my projects will live here.
