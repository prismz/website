<h3>anarchist resources</h3>
<h4>foreward</h4>
<p>
    since most anarchists are also socialist/communist (like myself), most of their
    work is released into the public domain or under copyleft licenses like the gplv2.
    this makes it incredibly easy to access and read anarchist texts.

    note: most of these resources contain various other works, which i highly suggest reading.
    don't be fooled by common misconceptions about anarchism and actually read some things.
    i suggest starting with anarchy works by peter gelderloos, as it is a fantastic introduction
    to anarchism and does a great job at debunking many of these common misconceptions.
