<h3>writing a static site generator</h3>

<p>
    when i started my new website, i needed a new and better way to generate articles.
    most people use markdown and have a program to convert it to html and add a header and footer,
    but i don't really like markdown. i already know html, so why not just have the article
    be in html? each article is stored in a source directory, with no html boilerplate - just
    the body of the article and the title and some comments at the top for metadata. a python
    script goes through each file in the directory, parses the title, adds a header and footer, 
    and then copies the file to a destination directory. the makefile on my server then deletes
    the directory with unformatted articles. if you'd like to see the code that generated the 
    current version of the website, you can look at it directly <a href="/gen.py">here</a>.
