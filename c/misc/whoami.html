<h3>who am i?</h3>

<p>
    i'm a 15 year old palestinian-american programmer. i'm not a good writer, but i like sharing
    about topics i like. i recently got a car so i may 
    put that here. this site serves as a hub for
    things i find interesting or things i wish i knew starting
    out in the linux/programming world.
</p>

<h4>my roots</h4>
<p>
    my palestinian roots are from al haram, jaffa. you can read more

<h4>my hobbies</h4>
<p>
    i'm a programmer and a linux enthusiast, but i also have a developing
    interest in cars. i also play the saxophone.
</p>

<h4>my pc setup</h4>
<p>
    c is my favorite programming language and i run
    gentoo linux on my main computer, debian on my servers,
    and arch linux on computers where i don't want to
    compile software. i (sadly) have an nvidia 1060, an amd 
    fx 6300 cpu, and 16gb of ram.
</p>

<h4>my projects</h4>
<p>
    most of my projects are written in c but i also use 
    python for other things. i like these languages because 
    they run basically anywhere and don't require a lot of
    setup to write/compile code.
