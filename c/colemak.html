<h3>switching to colemak</h3>
<h4>the beginning</h4>
<p>
   last night i was programming and my wrists started to hurt.
   i waited a while and they stopped hurting, but this still
   made me wonder: if i'm going to be typing my whole life, 
   i may as well be using the best layout for me, right?
   qwerty is no where near optimal, so i set out to find the 
   best layout for me. i had already tried dvorak in the past,
   but i really didn't like it.

<h4>workman</h4>
<p>
    i first discovered workman, and it seemed pretty nice at a 
    glance, but it had problems. i didn't use it for long enough to
    notice any ergonomic issues, but it messed up shortcuts and didn't
    have a very large community (compared to others), and it's repository
    seemed rather inactive. i still tried it, and although not a bad layout
    i still prefer colemak.
