<h1 class="title">Why I switched to Gentoo</h1>

<hr>

<p>A few days ago, I was curious and decided to check how long I had been running
Gentoo. If you&#8217;re curious, the following command should tell you when your
filesystem was created:</p>

<pre><code>stat &#47; | grep "Birth" | sed &#39;s&#47;Birth: &#47;&#47;g&#39; | cut -b 2-11
</code></pre>

<p>I switched to Gentoo ~7-8 months ago (<code>2021-08-18</code>). Since then I have learned a lot
about Linux and Gentoo itself. Although I wouldn&#8217;t recommend Gentoo to
those new to Linux, I would recommend it to users who&#8217;d like total control
over their system. If you don&#8217;t, I totally understand. In that case, it&#8217;s
perfectly fine to run Debian. I ran Debian for a while when I had to put
my Linux-learning on hold due to an influx in schoolwork, but I still felt
that Windows had become too alien to return to.</p>

<p>Gentoo is an incredible distribution for those willing to learn it and
willing to put up with the installation time. I will say that the time it
takes to install Gentoo is often exaggerated. Unless you&#8217;re on slower
hardware, a Gentoo install is pretty quick if you follow the handbook.
My installation took about 2 hours and leaving the system to compile
overnight.</p>

<p>I switched because I felt like Arch wasn&#8217;t really interesting anymore.
I wanted to learn more, and I wanted to control my system even more.
The idea of configuring and compiling the entire system from source
was very appealing to me. It took me a few tries (most of the time I
began the install and was unable to finish it due to time constraints).</p>

<p>By far the hardest part of the install was getting X to work with Nvidia.
Configuring the kernel was surprisingly straightforward.</p>

<p>I will say that the default install of Gentoo used less than half the RAM
of Arch or Debian (170MB as opposed to ~300-400MB). I also like OpenRC a
lot more than SystemD. I find it to be a lot simpler; it does what
I need it to do.</p>

<p>Gentoo also gives the ability to use exclusively free software, even
letting you pick which licenses to use (<code>ACCEPT_LICENSE</code>).</p>

<p>Gentoo has put an end to my distohopping. No matter what I want to do,
Gentoo does it.</p>
