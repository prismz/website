<h1 class="title">Why I use a very simple shell prompt</h1>

<hr>

<p>These days many people use a fancy shell prompt.
I&#8217;ve tried fancy shell prompts, and I actually used
one for a while. Later on, however, I ran into a few
problems with my large prompt.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When working with a terminal on a screen with
little available space, longer shell prompts
would wrap onto the next line.</p></li>
<li><p>When writing longer commands (typically with something
like executing <code>make</code> and then calling valgrind with
options, which I did quite often as a C programmer),
the commands would wrap onto the next line. This isn&#8217;t
really a problem unless you&#8217;re using a very small terminal,
but I use smaller terminals.</p></li>
<li><p>I use the terminal a lot. I&#8217;d probably say that <code>st</code> is my
most used program besides maybe <code>firefox-bin</code>. I always have
terminals open, even if I&#8217;m not directly using one. I leave
<code>mutt</code>, <code>htop</code>, and <code>cmus</code> open on another monitor. What this
means is that larger (especially multi-line) prompts require
you to clear the screen quite often. This is trivial, but it
becomes annoying having to scroll back up to look at the output
of a previous command, when you only ran it a couple commands
ago.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you think that I&#8217;m being unreasonable by complaining about line
breaks, most project style standards enforce a line length limit of
80 characters, a primary example being the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html#breaking-long-lines-and-strings">Linux kernel</a>.</p>

<p>The following is an example of my shell prompt over time:</p>

<pre><code>[(exit code) (time taken) (git) user@hostname path&#47;to&#47;cwd] $
[path&#47;to&#47;cwd] $
[bold(path&#47;to&#47;cwd)] $
path&#47;to&#47;cwd
%
</code></pre>

<p>I stopped showing the current directory because I found that after
changing directories I would almost always <code>ls</code> anyway, which would
almost always let me know where I was. In the rare case that I didn&#8217;t
know (or had left a terminal open and forgotten where I was), <code>pwd</code> is
fairly easy to type (though this is in my opinion the main downside
of removing the current directory from your prompt).</p>

<p>I also found that having a shell prompt with a consistent width was
very beneficial for scripting. You can look at my build of <code>st</code> as
an example. Using <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st/blob/master/st-copyout">Luke Smith&#8217;s script</a>
to copy the output of the previous command worked much better when
using a consistent shell prompt.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also found that it lets me focus better on what I&#8217;m actually
doing. The more crowded my shell is the less I feel I actually have
any space to type commands. You can&#8217;t make aliases for everything,
so it helps to have the extra terminal real estate.</p>

<p>If you really want a little more information, you could change the
color of the <code>%</code> to indicate the result of the previous command or
something else. If it&#8217;s red, the previous command failed. If it&#8217;s
bolded, you&#8217;re root, etc.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t use the terminal much, or just want the extra information,
then you can do as you&#8217;d like. But I&#8217;ve found that the more I used
the terminal, the smaller I made my shell prompt.</p>
