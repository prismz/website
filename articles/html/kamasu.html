<h1 class="title">A Review Of The Orient Kamasu</h1>

<hr>

<p>I love watches, but being a young student it can be hard to afford higher-end
luxury watches. Often most people opt for smart watches, but I don&#8217;t like the
way they look, and they present privacy concerns. I also doubt their durability.
There is also something to be said about their value. I don&#8217;t forsee anyone 
passing down their Apple Watch to their children.</p>

<p>Most people who still wear watches wear either smart watches or cheaper digital
quartz watches. Quartz watches are great, but in my opinion lack soul. I much
prefer the feeling of a mechanical or hand-wound movement. I think they&#8217;re much
cooler and demonstrate a much higher level of craftsmanship. The same argument
above also applies here - I don&#8217;t really see anyone passing down a Quartz watch
to their children. Quartz watches are durable and certainly have their place, 
but I wanted something automatic to wear every day.</p>

<p>With all this out of the way, many people recommend the Kamasu as a great budget
automatic diver. When I was looking for my first automatic watch, I saw loads of
good reviews for the Kamasu. Two things stood out to me: the sapphire crystal
and the day and date complication. After seeing these two things, I bought it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been about a month of owning and wearing it every day, and I have to say,
I&#8217;m impressed. I&#8217;m writing this review since I couldn&#8217;t really find many good
written reviews of the Kamasu online.</p>

<h1 id="price-and-value">Price and Value</h1>

<p>For the price point (~$200-$250 at the time of writing), it is quite hard to 
beat. </p>

<h1 id="bracelet">Bracelet</h1>

<p>The bracelet leaves a little to be desired. It scratches quite easily, and
with the hollow links, it&#8217;s likely to rattle around just a bit. This can be
solved if the watch is sized properly, however. </p>

<h1 id="movement">Movement</h1>

<p>Mine gains about 5 seconds a day. Not bad for an automatic watch at this price.
The fact that the movement inside is in-house is quite nice as well.</p>

<h1 id="looks">Looks</h1>

<p>The thing looks great. It isn&#8217;t likely to amaze another watch enthusiast, but I
have gotten quite a few compliments on it.</p>

<h1 id="cons">Cons</h1>

<p>Many people online complain about the crown being too small or the crown guards
making it hard to operate. I did not have either of these issues. The crown is
easy to cross thread however, so be careful with it. Screwing the crown down is
a bit finicky, however. You have to screw the crown backwards just a bit and 
then forwards to get it to properly grab the threads. This isn&#8217;t really a con, 
just something to be aware of so you don&#8217;t over-wind the watch the first time
you&#8217;re trying to screw down the crown.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like the days of the week also being in Spanish, as this results in a 
small window of time around 2-3 AM where the day of the week is in Spanish. This
isn&#8217;t a big deal, but can be slightly annoying.</p>
