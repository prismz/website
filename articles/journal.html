<p>A while back, I began journaling. I liked the idea of keeping journals
digitally, since I didn&#8217;t have a proper journal at the time.</p>

<p>All of the typical note-taking programs people usually use were too
much for what I wanted to do. I didn&#8217;t need a full office suite or image
support or cloud storage. I just needed a way to organize a directory of
text files.</p>

<p>I looked and didn&#8217;t really find any programs I liked, so I just wrote my
own, partly as a Haskell exercise.</p>
