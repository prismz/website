<p>The key to happiness is not worrying about the actions of others.
You can&#8217;t control what other people do. You can attempt to <em>influence</em> their actions,
but this is almost always in vain. Seeds of thought must be planted in fertile soil, so to speak.</p>

<h2 id="What%20about%20feelings?">What about feelings?</h2>

<p>You can&#8217;t control your feelings, but you can control
how you choose to handle them.</p>

<p>This all sounds rational until you&#8217;re angry or upset. Then it becomes
irrational and seemingly impossible. That is the difficult part.</p>

<p>Since implementing this Stoic line of thought, I have found that things tend to bother
me much less than they would have before. </p>

<p>I have found that by preventing myself from reacting emotionally to situations
that I can not control, I avoid a lot of pointless worrying.</p>

<p>I encourage you to take a Stoic approach to life. Find what works for you.</p>

<p>Note that this isn&#8217;t a substitute for therapy or any other mental help.
Do what you can to maintain a happy and fulfilling existence.</p>
