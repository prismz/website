The key to happiness is not worrying about the actions of others.
You can't control what other people do. You can attempt to *influence* their actions,
but this is almost always in vain. Seeds of thought must be planted in fertile soil, so to speak.

# What about feelings?

You can't control your feelings, but you can control
how you choose to handle them.

This all sounds rational until you're angry or upset. Then it becomes
irrational and seemingly impossible. That is the difficult part.

Since implementing this Stoic line of thought, I have found that things tend to bother
me much less than they would have before. 

I have found that by preventing myself from reacting emotionally to situations
that I can not control, I avoid a lot of pointless worrying.

I encourage you to take a Stoic approach to life. Find what works for you.

Note that this isn't a substitute for therapy or any other mental help.
Do what you can to maintain a happy and fulfilling existence.
