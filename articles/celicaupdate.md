An Update On The Celica
Jun 01, 2023

It's been a while since my first post about the Celica. 

Things haven't exactly been going well with it.

The first engine spun a bearing, so we threw another one in. The one we threw
in was from a junkyard, and sat out in the elements for quite a long time. This
meant that none of the seals or gaskets survived, including the head gasket. I
figured that when they replaced the engine, they would replace the gaskets and
seals. They replaced almost every component but the damn seals. So alas, the 
engine is now in the car and has a blown head gasket as well.

I sanded the car right before the engine blew, preparing it for paint, as that 
was next up on the list. Since the engine blew, the car has been sanded and 
without paint for about a year now while I've been waiting on the mechanical 
side of the car to be decent.

The engine is currently being rebuilt, and the head has been redone by a machine
shop. The bottom end of the engine was fine (thankfully), so luckily nothing had
to be done there.

I cut the muffler off and threw some headers on it, and its very loud now. It
sounds like shit at low rpms since it's basically a straight piped four banger 
now, but at the higher rpms it sounds great. I'm hoping to get a proper exhaust
system put together, but of course I need the car running on all four cylinders
before I can do that.

I will post another update once this engine is in good working order.

I've been eyeing up a few Lexus LS400s in my area for a daily driver. There's 
one that's been blacked out with wheels on it nearby that I'm planning on going
to get soon. I may write about that car as well, depending on how it goes. If I
don't get that LS400, I'll get another one. They're easy to find where I'm at.
