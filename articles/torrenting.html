    <h1>Torrenting</h1>
    <b>if you get in trouble, its not my fault! You choose what you download, not me.</b><br>
    <a href="/index.html"><- home</a><br><br>

    Torrenting porn is a waste of time and bandwidth, but I have included sites for that as well.
    Porn is addictive and you shouldn't even watch it in the first place, but me saying that won't stop
    you. Don't torrent games, either. Downloading .exes is too risky and games most people pirate 
    are a waste of time in general.
    <br><br>
    I can not say this enough:<br>
    <b>USE OPEN SOURCE/FREE SOFTWARE THAT DOESN'T TRACK YOU! EVERYTHING ON THE SOFTWARE LIST IS OPEN-SOURCE, AND MULLVAD WON'T SELL YOUR LOGS TO THE POLICE IF YOU DO SOMETHING STUPID</b>
    <br><br><br>

    <b>things you'll need:</b><br>
    <code>
        <a href="https://mullvad.net">Mullvad VPN</a> - best VPN. only 5 euros (~5.50 freedom bucks). 
        you could get this or something else as long as you get a VPN. be warned that most VPN companies
        will out you out to the feds if you download something illegal. Mullvad won't do that.
