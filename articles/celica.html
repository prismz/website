<p>When I at the age of 14 realized that I was close to driving, I
started to get into cars. My favorite cars were (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
<li>Nissan 300zx</li>
<li>Nissan 240SX</li>
<li>~1989 Honda Prelude</li>
<li>Old muscle cars (too many to list)</li>
<li>Toyota Corolla (AE86 bodystyle)</li>
<li>Toyota AE86</li>
</ul>

<p>I looked around my area, starting with old muscle cars
and classics. Then I looked for old Japanese cars (imports),
and then for everything else on my list. My only requirement
was that the car had a manual transmission and was reasonably
priced.</p>

<p>I was upset because I couldn&#8217;t find a car in my price range
that wouldn&#8217;t take forever to fix. When all hope seemed lost,
My dad noticed a new listing on Facebook marketplace. A 1990 Toyota
Celica. He drove 30-45 minutes to meet the seller, and paid cash for it,
all while I was in school.</p>

<p>It sat in a barn for 2 years, and it had a lot of problems, 
but they were all fixable. Here&#8217;s a list
of some of the major issues starting out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bad leak in the power steering pump</li>
<li>Dry rotted tires</li>
<li>Engine ran very rough</li>
<li>Sunroof leak</li>
<li>Broken trunk</li>
<li>Some broken wiring (various places)</li>
<li>All lights (except the headlights) were out.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, I&#8217;ve fixed most of the above issues. As it stands,
All issues are cosmetic. The paintjob is ugly and faded, there
is some rust around the hatchback, the window tint is
chipped and peeling, and the A&#47;C needs Freon. Other than that, everything
is perfect.</p>

<p>It drives very well, and I&#8217;ve pushed it up to ~95 mph on the highway
with no issues. I also learned to drive stick on it with no problems.
I can&#8217;t wait to see it when the bodywork and painting is done.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what it looked like when I first got it:</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s what it looks like now:</p>

<p><img src="/media/celica2.jpeg" alt="Now" /></p>

<p>I still have a lot of things I want to do to it, and I&#8217;ll do my best
to update this article as I make changes.</p>
