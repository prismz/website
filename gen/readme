This folder contains Haskell code to generate the site.
Note that all articles written in markdown must have HTML inline elements, as
these have not been implemented in the parser yet.

I wrote this code to practice my Haskell, and it is *very* messy.

boilerplate.html is the boilerplate for each article, and
indextemplate.html is the template for the home page.

Note that %CONTENTS%, %TITLE%, and %ARTICLELIST% are on their
own lines. This is required.
